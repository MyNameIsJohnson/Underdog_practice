Interview question: Scrabble solver

This is a real 60-minute interview question at a tech company.

Part 1

Write code that:

- Accepts a string (either as a command-line argument or as an argument to a function)
- Prints out the words that can be made from those characters, along with their Scrabble scores, one word per line, in descending score order

Example input and output:

`$ python scrabble_cheater.py SPCQEIU  # Use any language you like.`
`17 piques`
`17 equips`
`16 quips`
`16 pique`
`16 equip`
`15 quip`
`…`

Resources:

- Word list
- Letter scores
Part 2

Extend the script to handle blank tiles. When reading the input, the character _ can be used as a wildcard — it can represent any letter.

Wildcards do not count towards a word's score.

1. Need to get all possible combination of each filled in blanks 

2. i have a array of arrays of permutations the needs each of its strings to be compared to a dictionary and scored

3. the array of arrays needs to be 1 array 

4. then each string in this array can be used to calcualate its score 


Notes: 4/13 
Focus on smaller problems before thinking about end output.
